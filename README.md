# OSINTsources
This is a repo containing several open source intelligence (OSINT) sources - curated by [AWARE7 GmbH](https://aware7.com). 

Open Source Intelligence consists of every source that is freely available on the internet. It can be (ab)used in various kinds of ways but knowing where to find anything is quite a helpful skill 
in the modern age. 

We use some of these sources during our professional [penetration testing](https://aware7.com/penetration-testing/) or [spear phishing](https://aware7.com/perform-phishing-simulation/) engagements.

If you find a non-working link or miss a source please report it via an issue here on github or via mail to code(@)aware7.de
